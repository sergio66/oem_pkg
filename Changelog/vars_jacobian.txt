  this MAT file contains the channel freqs, jacobians, as well as the normalizations used in making the jacobians

chanset
  which of the 2378 (or 8462) chans to use in the retrieval

numlays     : when doing Q1(z),Q2(z), ..QN(z) and T(z), how many layers to expect
numQlays    : tells how many QN gases we have (must be at least 1 which is typically assumed to be WV)
            : always assumes we have info for T(z)
gasID_Qlays : tells you which QN gases you want to change profiles for (this is really only needed if
           you are running off rodgers_spectra.m as you need to update those profiles before
           running sarta). Minium is [1] as code assumes at very least, you are retrieving WV

Q1jacindex : indices to state which layers to use
tjacindex  : indices to state which layers to use

qstnames : what column jacs we have eg CO2, O3strat, O3trop, stemp, HDO
qstYesOrNo : indices to state which of these gases to use

Jacobian rules : 
  for spectral rates, do what you want, together with qrenorm (eg have been working with CO2
    jacobians normalized to 2.2 ppmv/yr, and N2o jacobians normalized to 1.0 ppb/yr
  for spectral observations, 
    for T(z), stemp and scanang : use (r(T+1)-r(T))/1
    for column gases, and cloud params : use [r(X(1+delta))-r(X(1)]/log10(1+delta)
    for layer gases QN(z) : use [r(Xn(1+delta))-r(Xn(1)]/log10(1+delta)
    and qrenorm = 1 for all the geophysical params you are retrieving
    See example : Test/perturb_49regr_profiles_spectraljacs.m
