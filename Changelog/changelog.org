Change Log for Rate Fitting Code

* Notes
- Src is at ~/Work/Rates/Fit\_pkg

* Changes
** [2011-08-25 Thu] (LLS)
- Fixed problems with adjust_rates.
- Added diagonal regularization for temp and water
** [2011-08-15 Mon] (LLS)
- Jacobians now normalized.  max(sum(abs(temp))) =
  max(sum(abs(water))) = max(abs(gasi)) Jacobians.  See get\_jac.m
- get\_jac.m no longer squeezes the jacobians for the parameters being
  fit.  This is left to retrieval.m.  This way, the jacobians
  outputted by get\_jacs.m are "full" and can be used by adjust_rates.m
  to remove the effects of some gas using a known rate.
- Three lambda's are now used.  gas/water/temp.  The original lambda
  is now only used if you invoke regularization only on the diagonal. 
- Test directory using new covariance matrices (L1 with larger numbers
  for i=1:6) and a true apriori\_zero = all zeros.
- In oem_lls.m separated mean square variance of the fitted
  coefficients in three separate parts: gases, water, temp.  Save in
  driver.oem.coeff_var_xxx where xxx = gas,water,temp.  This allows
  you to do the L-curve separately for each coefficient type.
** [2011-08-08 Mon]
- Removed "cluster" stuff.
- Many many code changes, mostly to simplify.
  - Large speed-up by doing multiple pinv's only once and saving
  - Assume cov input matrix is the regularization matrix!
  - Used inv instead of pinv for the gain matrix
- Both the Jacobian file and the covariance file now must have same
  ordering.  [gases columns (1-5) T_surf wv(1:97), t(1:97)]
- Removed lamba loop, user creates this loop externally if needed
- For now, put gain and ak matrices in driver output
- Fixed qrenorm to reflect that T-Jacobians were scaled by 0.01, not
  0.1
- Changed find_cov_derivoperators to remove qrenorm scaling on L matrices
- lambda input is now not scaled by 10^(lambda)
- NOTE: testing now done with a L1 matrix (unity lambda2)

** [2011-08-05 08:00]
- the Cluster directory allows you to put the below job on the
  cluster, using run\_tara
** [2011-08-04 21:00]
- set\_default\_struct is used to set defaults
- these are then overwritten by calling driver =
  override\_defaults(driver,ix); where "ix" is the latbin you want to
  run.  So for example a loop to do all latbins would be 
  #+BEGIN_SRC matlab
  for ix=1:36
     clear driver; 
     run_retrieval; 
  end
  #+END_SRC
** [2011-08-02 05:05]
- jacobian file now has the qrenormalization information
** [2011-08-01 21:50]
- driver.map\_jac2cov allows you to map indices from Jacobian to Covariance
** [2011-08-01 14:14]
- Covariance matrix format changed; no top level structure name.
  =oem_lls.m= changed to reflect this, see =b0=.
- Apriori format changed; no top level structure name.
  =oem_lls.m= changed to reflect this, see =zset=, and =zstd=.
- Changed debugging approach, using Matlab code like:
  #+BEGIN_SRC matlab
  if driver.debug
    addpath Debug
    debug_cov
    rmpath Debug
  end
  #+END_SRC
  These scripts are in the =Debug= directory.
- Created directory Changelog to hold this file and its various output
  formats.

This is just a comment to test if I can send this to the taro repository.
